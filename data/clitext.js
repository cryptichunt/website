        The hunt will be in the form of a board game. Every tile on the board
        will represent one of 4 things- a level, a tile sharing a piece of
        information related to the overlying story (the story will be released
        in a few days), one of the 4 unique corners or a random chance tile.
        Further details regarding every tile will be detailed later.

        Your movements, and your fate, will be decided by the roll of a virtual
        die. There is no cooldown time period on how often you can roll the die,
        however, you must complete the actions of the tile you are on (eg. solve
        the level, read the story, finish the random chance tile
        action/encounter) before you can roll the die again and move on. Tiles
        that you have visited before become greyed out. You can roll the die
        again without any delay if you land on a previously visited, greyed out
        tile.

        Teaming or forming alliances: now this has always been a controversial
        part of every hunt. In Cryptocracy, everyone is allowed to team up or
        form an alliance, even though it's an individual hunt. Everyone can
        "cheat". This doesn't mean that people can cheat so extensively that it
        is apparent to the admins. There are two ways you can get banned - 1)
        Your alliance gets noticed by us, or 2) If the participant(s) you are
        teaming up with report you. The details of this reporting system will be
        explained tomorrow. Also, you might've noticed that there was no
        day-eight-rule.txt. Strange, isn't it?
