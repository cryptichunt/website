There is no cooldown time period on how often you can roll the die, however, you must complete the actions of the tile you are on (eg. solve the level, read the story, finish the random chance tile action/encounter) before you can roll the die again and move on. Tiles that you have visited before become greyed out. You can roll the die again without any delay if you land on a previously visited, greyed out tile.</text>,
