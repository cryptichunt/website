        will represent one of 4 things- a level, a tile sharing a piece of
        information related to the overlying story (the story will be released
        in a few days), one of the 4 unique corners or a random chance tile.
        Further details regarding every tile will be detailed later.

        Your movements, and your fate, will be decided by the roll of a virtual
        die. There is no cooldown time period on how often you can roll the die,
        however, you must complete the actions of the tile you are on (eg. solve
        the level, read the story, finish the random chance tile
        action/encounter) before you can roll the die again and move on. Tiles
        that you have visited before become greyed out. You can roll the die
        again without any delay if you land on a previously visited, greyed out
        tile.

        Teaming or forming alliances: now this has always been a controversial
        part of every hunt. In Cryptocracy, everyone is allowed to team up or
        form an alliance, even though it's an individual hunt. Everyone can
        "cheat". This doesn't mean that people can cheat so extensively that it
        is apparent to the admins. There are two ways you can get banned - 1)
        Your alliance gets noticed by us, or 2) If the participant(s) you are
        teaming up with report you. The details of this reporting system will be
        explained tomorrow. Also, you might've noticed that there was no
        day-eight-rule.txt. Strange, isn't it?

        The Bounty System: a person can turn in the participant(s) who've
        contacted them for answers if they have sufficient proof of teaming. For
        each person you report you will get the bounty that was on that player's
        head. The exact amount you will receive will be revealed along with the
        rest of the game economy. A person can report the guilty individual
        within 30 minutes of them last approaching the player for answers.

        The 4 corners of the map are:
        <br />
        1) Bottom-Right is the “GO”, players will collect a small number of
        points when they pass it, but the amount of points is limited i.e. it
        gets exhausted after a while so that players cannot keep passing GO and
        to farm points after they’re done with the levels.
        <br />
        2) Bottom-Left is the Jail where players will have to serve their
        sentence.
        <br />
        3) Top-Left is the gate to the enter the inner tiles, you need to have
        completed a certain number of levels from the outer tiles before you can
        enter the inner ones.
        <br />
        4) Top-Right is a mystery square. It’s contents will get revealed
        mid-game.
